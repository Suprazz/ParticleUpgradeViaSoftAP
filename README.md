# ParticleUpgradeViaSoftAP
Particle photon firmware upgrade over SoftAP.

You can upgrade the firmware of your Particle Photon connected over the SoftAP with a computer or Android phone connected to the SoftAP hotspot.

This is useful for devices that are off grid and needs firmware upgrade.

An exernal memory is required to do this because doing the upgrade directly in the myPage handler cause problems (always return an upgrade failed. No sure why and tired of wasting my time)..
I'm using an external SPI flash IS25LQ080 with chip select on A7 but it can be an SD card too.

For the moment, it doesn't work with an Iphone because there is an issue while reading the last part of the data with the body->read function. (I dont understand why but only the last buffer can't be read completly with the body->read functino... Maybe an other issue in the WICED.)

Connect to the hotspot, navitage to 192.168.0.1 and select a binary file generated by the online ide or compile using cli command particle compile photon c:\myapp
